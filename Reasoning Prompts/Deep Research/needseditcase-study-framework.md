# Comparative Case Study Research Framework

## Core Structure

### 1. Reference Case Selection
- Identify 2-3 exemplar cases that represent different approaches
- Define specific criteria for case selection
- Include both successful and challenging examples
- Consider timeline and context relevance

### 2. Deep Contextual Analysis
- Historical background for each case
- Environmental factors
- Key stakeholders involved
- Resource constraints
- Critical decision points

### 3. Cross-Case Comparison Points
- Common challenges faced
- Different approaches taken
- Resource allocation strategies
- Implementation methods
- Outcome measurements

### 4. Pattern Recognition
- Shared success factors
- Common pitfalls
- Recurring challenges
- Innovation patterns
- Adaptation strategies

## Example Prompts

### Programming Agents
"Analyze three significant LLM agent implementations: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, and Amazon CodeWhisperer. For each case, examine the specific technical challenges they faced in handling code generation, how they approached testing and validation, and their methods for maintaining code quality. Compare their approaches to handling edge cases, API integration, and security concerns. What patterns emerge across these implementations that could inform future development?"

### Business Strategy
"Examine three platform businesses that successfully disrupted traditional markets: Airbnb in hospitality, Stripe in payments, and Shopify in retail. For each case, investigate their initial market entry strategy, how they built their two-sided marketplace, and their approach to regulation. Compare their methods for scaling, handling trust and safety, and maintaining growth. What common patterns emerge in their evolution from startup to market leader?"

### Urban Planning
"Study three cities that transformed their urban cores: Copenhagen's bicycle infrastructure, Seoul's Cheonggyecheon restoration, and Barcelona's superblocks. For each case, examine the initial conditions, community resistance, implementation approach, and measured outcomes. Compare their strategies for public engagement, phasing, and impact assessment. What patterns emerge in successful urban transformation projects?"

### Education
"Investigate three innovative educational programs: Khan Academy's mastery learning, Lambda School's ISA model, and Minerva's active learning approach. For each case, examine their pedagogical foundations, implementation challenges, and assessment methods. Compare their approaches to scaling, student engagement, and outcome measurement. What patterns emerge in successful educational innovation?"
