## Example Prompts

### Programming Agents
"I need a report on the evolution of LLM coding assistants, especially the major approaches that have emerged over the past year, and the standout implementations of each. Make it an interesting read with examples of how different assistants handle the same coding tasks. Start with early code completion tools but focus most on post-ChatGPT developments. All languages, all development environments, no need for benchmarks unless they help, but good narratives with sections contrasting examples of how different assistants might tackle the same programming challenge - maybe show how each would approach refactoring legacy code or implementing a new feature?"

### Business Strategy
"I need a report on the evolution of market disruption strategies, especially the major schools of thought that have emerged since digital transformation, and the standout companies of each. Make it an interesting read with examples of strategic moves in action. Start with traditional competitive strategy but focus most on post-platform economy developments. All industries, all scales, no need for frameworks unless they help, but good narratives with sections contrasting examples of how different strategies might play out - maybe show how each approach would handle entering a saturated market?"

### Urban Planning
"I need a report on the evolution of urban design philosophy, especially the major movements that have emerged in the age of climate awareness, and the standout cities of each. Make it an interesting read with examples of design principles in action. Start with car-centric planning but focus most on post-2015 developments. All scales, all climates, no need for maps unless they help, but good narratives with sections contrasting examples of how different approaches might reshape the same neighborhood - maybe show how each philosophy would transform a typical suburban block?"

### Education
"I need a report on the evolution of learning environments, especially the major pedagogical approaches that have emerged in the digital age, and the standout programs of each. Make it an interesting read with examples of teaching methods in action. Start with traditional classrooms but focus most on post-pandemic developments. All subjects, all age groups, no need for data unless it helps, but good narratives with sections contrasting examples of how different approaches might handle the same learning objective - maybe show how each would teach critical thinking skills?"

### Original Template Example (TTRPG Prompt)
"I need a report on evolution in TTRPGs, especially the major families of rules that have evolved over the past few years, and the emblematic games of each. Make it an interesting read with examples of gameplay mechanics. Start with the 1970s but focus most on post 2010. All genres, all types, no need for a chart unless it helps, but good narratives with sections contrasting examples of how the game might actually play. Maybe the same sort of gameplay challenge under different mechanics?"
